## 🧪 Practice Project: Minimal E-Commerce API

To reinforce your learning throughout this roadmap, you’ll build a **Minimal E-Commerce API**, a hands-on project designed to help you apply each phase’s concepts in a real-world scenario.

- 🔧 Built with **.NET 8**, **Clean Architecture**, **CQRS**, and **DDD**
- 🧱 Structured as **microservices**: Product Service, Order Service, and Auth Service
- 🔐 Covers key skills including authentication, data access, performance optimization, and deployment
- 🧪 Includes unit tests, integration tests, CI/CD, and API performance best practices

You’ll progressively implement this project as you move through the roadmap phases. View the project [here](mini-projects\Minimal.ECommerce\README.md)
