## ðŸ§® Mini Project: Console-Based Student Management System

**Description**:  
Build a command-line application that allows users to manage a list of students with features like adding, editing, deleting, searching, and listing student records. This project integrates key concepts such as OOP, collections, exception handling, delegates/events, and uses the .NET CLI for building and running the app.

 **Features**
- Add, edit, delete students
- Display all students
- Search students by name or ID
- Sort students by GPA or name
- (Optional) Save/load student data to/from a file


### ðŸ“š Concepts Applied

| Concept | Applied In |
|--------|-------------|
| **C# Basics** | Variables, loops, conditionals for program logic |
| **OOP** | `Student` class, `StudentManager` class, interfaces for abstraction |
| **Exception Handling** | Input validation, error handling, try-catch blocks |
| **Delegates & Events** | Notify when students are added/removed |
| **Collections & Generics** | `List<Student>`, sorting/filtering, LINQ queries |
| **.NET CLI** | Project setup and management using `dotnet new`, `dotnet run` |


> ðŸ’¡ This project provides hands-on experience and prepares you for real-world application development. Try to implement features step by step to solidify your understanding.
