# .NET CLI Basics

## What is the .NET CLI and Why is it Useful?

The .NET CLI is a cross-platform toolchain for developing, building, running, and publishing .NET applications. Think of it as a text-based interface to interact with the .NET SDK (Software Development Kit).

### Benefits for Developers

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, enabling consistent workflows across environments.
- **Lightweight**: Ideal for scripting, automation, or working on systems without a full IDE.
- **Flexibility**: Provides fine-grained control over project creation, dependency management, and publishing.
- **Automation-Friendly**: Easily integrates with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).
- **Learning Tool**: Helps beginners understand the .NET build process by exposing each step explicitly.
